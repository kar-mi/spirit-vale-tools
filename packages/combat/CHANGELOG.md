## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- bee121d: Fix toggle-style statuses (e.g. `Vitality`, or any status with no duration data) getting stuck active forever when their `RemoveEffect_T` packet is dropped. `FishNetStatusTracker` now clears an actor's active statuses when the actor despawns (`actorIdentity` `remove`), dies (`Death_C`), or the connection resets (zone transition/relog) - instead of relying solely on an explicit remove event, or (for zone transitions) blindly carrying stale statuses forward to the new actorId. Zone transitions reliably re-send `ApplyEffect_T` for whatever's genuinely still active shortly after loading, so clearing on reset and trusting that resync is both safe and closes the gap where a status that had actually already ended kept surviving every subsequent map change.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 86aefa5: Decode `HealthComponent.Recover_C` and expose it from `FishNetCombatTracker` as a new `FishNetCombatHealEvent` (`kind: "heal"`). Healer attribution is best-effort, since the RPC carries no healer id: single matching healing-skill cast targeting the recipient resolves to `attribution: "exact"`/`"inferred"`, overlapping candidates resolve to `"ambiguous"`, and no match resolves to `"unattributed"` (still reports the healed target and amount). `parseDpsLogRecord` now recognizes `kind: "heal"` records from persisted logs.

  Also attribute heals that land via the `Regeneration` status (`Sanctuary`, `GuardianBond`, `SanctuaryField`, `HealAll` — per `Regeneration`'s effect list in the statuses catalog) instead of an immediate `Recover_C`: the caster is resolved once when `StatusComponent.ApplyEffect_T` grants the status (correlated against a recent matching cast, same ambiguity rules as direct heals) and reused for every `Recover_C` tick on that target until `RemoveEffect_T` clears it.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 4896919: Fix `FishNetStatusTracker` dropping still-active statuses (e.g. Haste) from `getActiveStatusesForName` after a zone transition or relog. An `actorIdentity` reset reassigns the local player a new `actorId` and clears the name lookup to avoid misattributing a recycled `actorId` to the wrong character, but previously the still-tracked buffs/debuffs under the old `actorId` were never reconciled, so they silently vanished from consumers like the overlay even though the buff was still running in-game. `consumeIdentity` now remembers the last known `actorId` per `uid` across resets and migrates that `actorId`'s active statuses onto the new one as soon as the same `uid` re-upserts, closing the gap. Other actors' identity events don't carry a `uid`, so this only applies to the local player and doesn't change recycled-`actorId` behavior for anyone else.
